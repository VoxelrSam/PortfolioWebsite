					<p>
						My name is Samuel Ingram, or Sam as most people call me, and I am currently enrolled in Computer Science at Purdue. I absolutely love both technology and music. Both fascinate me, and I always enjoy learning more about each subject.
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						As of now, I am a freshman at Purdue University trying my best to obtain a bachelor of science in computer science within four years. While at Purdue, I have so far been making the most of my resources and opportunities here. For instance, I have joined the Purdue Virtual Reality Club to expand my knowledge of VR and gets hands on experience developing games for such a new and exciting platform. Since arriving at Purdue, I have also signed up for a hackathon called Hello World which is geared towards those who would love attend a hackathon but never have in the past. At Purdue I hope to grow my knowledge of technology through both my major and the opportunities around me.
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						The most effective way to summarize one of my main interests is by calling me a "tech enthusiast." From a very early age, I expressed interest in technology though the one way a young kid knows the best; I loved video games. My earliest memories consist of playing the Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and the GameCube. I would delve into the worlds of the video game characters and find strategies behind the levels and moves. An unexplained love grew in me for these games and the technology behind them, and I became interested in video game development and how people could create such games as a job. The allure of technology captured my interest and continued to grow in my mind.
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						Music has always played a big part in my life, and I have continued to get involved in any way that I can. I have played on multiple worship teams for about three years now, and I also continue to expand my knowledge of other instruments in my own time. The current running list of instruments that I can play consists of the acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, ukulele, trumpet, piano, and just a bit of drums. Most of the instruments that I play I have taken lessons for, but others like the ukulele, bass guitar, and drums I have all taught to myself using online resources. I have always enjoyed music, and I plan to continue learning more and more throughout my life.

						Most of what I like to do can be summarized into the two categories of technology and music. I am a hands on person, and if I develop an interest for a project or concept, I love to take it on myself and learn all about it!

									To most people building a computer may sound like a drag, but to me building a computer sounds like a fun way to spend my afternoon. I never realized just how much fun I could have with technology until I received my laptop for one of my birthdays. From the moment that that laptop was in my possession, I gained a whole new world of technological possibilities and fun through PC games and the many other applications possible through a PC. It was not long after receiving my laptop that I built a desktop computer for gaming and general media production. My computer has served me well through the games offered and through the fun that I had building it. I knew then that computers were devices that I could have a plethora of fun with, and I knew that I wanted to go into the tech industry as a future job.
								</p>
								<br/>
								
								<p>
									Even considering the amount of fun one may have on computers, they are not all fun and games. I quickly became interested in the different production capabilities of computers and how they could create such works as websites and videos. I delved into the depths of the internet and taught myself to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also picked up skills to edit videos and produce graphics in Photoshop. These skills provided me with small and rewarding jobs that popped up from time to time. I created multiple websites and edited many videos while even being paid for many of them. Not only did computers provide me with a way to have fun, but they also provided me with a way to make some extra cash.

						<p>
							Music has established itself as a huge part of my life. I love both listening to music and playing music, but more than that, I enjoy creating music. Music writing acts as my creative outflow amongst the logic-filled world of computers and technology. I have applied my musical knowledge towards creating songs on my computer using a program called FL Studio. I always find it interesting to experiment with different sounds and find the perfect chord progressions to fit the ideas in my head. I hope to continue making music in the future and to expand upon my understanding of the music making process.
